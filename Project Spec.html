<h1><i>Tetris</i></h1>

<a href=http://tetris.com><i>Tetris</i></a> is a tile-matching game 
that came out of the Soviet Union in 1984, at the height of the Cold War. 
It is one of the <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games>most popular video games</a> ever written, 
appearing in many versions and selling hundreds of millions of copies. 
There are many different versions of <i>Tetris</i> 
(it's a great game and scientists even say that 
<a href=http://www.engadget.com/2009/09/01/tetris-players-found-to-have-greater-brain-efficiency-thicker-c>it's good for you</a>!), 
but fundamentally the basic idea is as follows. 
<p>
<ol>
<li>The board is a semi-infinite rectangle of width <i>w</i> units, with the open end upwards. 
<p><li>There are seven distinct pieces, each a contiguous block of four equal squares, each of side <i>1</i> unit. 
The pieces are known as <i>tetrominoes</i>. 
(Pieces and their representations are described below.) 
<p><li><i>n</i> pieces are delivered in a sequence from the open end of the board. 
<p><li>The player has a buffer that can hold up to <i>b</i> pieces at one time. 
<p><li>Denoting the next unprocessed piece in the sequence by <i>X</i>, 
at a typical moment in the game the player has 1-3 options: 
<p>
<ul>
<li>place <i>X</i> onto the board; or 
<li>if the buffer is not full, add <i>X</i> into the buffer; or 
<li>if the buffer is not empty, place any piece from the buffer onto the board. 
</ul>
<p>
The first two options consume <i>X</i>: the third option does not 
(i.e. <i>X</i> is still the next unprocessed piece). 
<p><li>Placing a piece onto the board involves four steps, 
which we will view as happening in this order: 
<p>
<ol>
<li>rotate the piece <i>90r</i> degrees anti-clockwise, 
where <i>r</i> is an integer in <i>0 .. 3</i>; then 
<li>locate the piece <i>k</i> units from the left wall, 
where <i>k</i> is an integer in <i>0 .. w-1</i> (but the piece cannot protrude outside the right wall); then 
<li>slide the piece downwards until some part of it collides 
either with the bottom wall or with some part of a previously-placed piece; then 
<li>for all lines across the rectangle which are completely full of squares, 
delete those lines and slide all higher squares down accordingly. 
</ol>
<p>
</ol>
The goal is to place all <i>n</i> pieces onto the board such that the final placement occupies as little height as possible. 
(Other (broadly equivalent) goals may be to complete a certain number of lines as quickly as possible, 
or to keep the height of the squares on the board within some limit.)
<p>
A <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris>Wikipedia page</a> exists which discusses <i>Tetris</i>. 
There are many, many <i>Tetris</i> games available online, for example at <a href=http://tetris.com><i>tetris.com</i></a>. 

<br><br><hr>

<h2>Pieces and their representation</h2>

Each <i>Tetris</i> piece is a contiguous block of four equal squares called a <i>tetromino</i>, 
and pieces can be rotated by increments of 90 degrees, so there are seven distinct pieces. 
<p><font size=14><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7</i></font>
<p><img src=Pieces.png><p>
An instance of the problem is described by a text file where all characters in <i>1 .. 7</i> 
denote pieces, and all other characters can be ignored, 
for example <a href=exampleinput.txt>exampleinput.txt</a>. 
<p>
A placement of <i>n</i> pieces is described by a text file (like <a href=exampleoutput.txt>exampleoutput.txt</a>) containing <i>n</i> lines. 
Each line has the form <i>x y z</i>, where <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i> are all integers and 
<ul>
<li><i>1 <= x <= 7</i> &nbsp;denotes a piece to be placed, 
<li><i>0 <= y <= 3</i> &nbsp;denotes an anti-clockwise rotation of that piece by <i>90y</i> degrees 
(so <i>0</i> denotes the orientation shown above), and 
<li><i>0 <= z</i> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;denotes 
that the rotated piece should be dropped <i>z</i> units from the left wall 
(any <i>z</i> which is too big will leave the rotated piece touching the right wall). 
</ul>
<p>
The placement file 
<a href=exampleoutput.txt>exampleoutput.txt</a> gives this <a href=svgs/h015.svg>final board</a>, 
where "up" is pointing rightwards. 
The files <i>h001.svg - h014.svg</i> show the partial placements of these pieces: 
three lines were cleared, 
after the 9th, 14th, and 15th pieces. 
<p>
Each output file will be checked for legal syntax and for consistency with the corresponding input file 
(i.e. that it places the pieces in a legal order). 
<br><br><hr>

<h2>Submission</h2>

You are required to construct a player for the version of <i>Tetris</i> described here. 
Your program should read an <a href=exampleinput.txt>input file</a> specifying the sequence of <i>n</i> pieces, 
and it should output a <a href=exampleoutput.txt>file</a> specifying the placement of those pieces. 
It should choose a placement that minimises the maximum height of the squares on the final board. 
<p>
<ul>
<li>Initally, you can assume that <i>w = 11, b = 1, n <= 1,000</i>. 
If you are able to generalise your system beyond these values 
(or even to pieces with five squares!), that would be great. 
<li>Aim for a system that can process maybe 5-10 pieces per second. 
<li>More example data will be available from here in due course. 
</ul>
<p>
You must submit two deliverables via 
<a href="http://www.cs.uwa.edu.au/run/cssubmit">cssubmit</a>: 
<ul>
<li>the code you generate in the project, as a zip archive; and 
<li>a paper describing and analysing your work, as a PDF file. 
</ul>
<p>The paper should be about 5-10 pages long: it should describe 
the structure and design of your program, and include any 
(experimental or theoretical) analysis that you have performed. 
<p>
<b>If you use or refer to other people's work, make sure that you give all due credit.</b>

<br><br><hr>

<h2>Analysis and assistance</h2>

I may offer assistance of various kinds at some stages of the project. 
Such assistance will be announced via 
<a href=https://secure.csse.uwa.edu.au/run/help4211><i>help4211</i></a>, or on this page. 
On the following list, more-recent additions are nearer the top. 
<ol>
<p><li>I have a Haskell program which reads in a placement file and produces a sequence of svg files, 
of the type shown above. If that would be useful to you, let me know - 
otherwise I am planning a Python program which does the same in the near future...</li>
<p><li>The seven pieces have an average of <i>2.7</i> distinct rotations, and 
for <i>w = 11</i>, an average of about <i>26</i> distinct placements. 
Thus even if <i>b = 0</i>, 
<i>n</i> given pieces generate roughly <i>26 ^ n</i> distinct output sequences 
(although clearly not all of them generate distinct placements). 
With a non-zero buffer, this number is much higher. 
It's a hard problem! 
</ol>

<br><br><hr>

<h2>Assessment</h2>

The project is designed to be done in pairs. 
No larger groups will be allowed, but you may do a solo project if you prefer. 
<p>
You may decide how to distribute the various project tasks (for example programming, 
testing, collecting empirical data, producing plots, writing, etc) between the group members, 
but the marks will be divided evenly, so the workload should be roughly equal too. 
<p>
The project counts for 25% of your mark for CITS4211. 
Assessment will be based on 
<ul>
<li>how well you have used the AI algorithms that we have studied, 
<li>how well you have analysed the problem, 
<li>how well you have analysed your program, 
<li>how well your program plays <i>Tetris</i>, 
<li>how well your paper is written, 
<li>and anything else that occurs to me at the time. 
</ul>
<p>You should consult the School's guidelines on plagiarism, available from the 
<a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/students/units/cits4211">unit outline</a>. 

<br><br><hr>

<h2>Deadline</h2>

The project is due by <b>4pm on Wednesday 29 May</b>. 
<p>
Standard penalties will apply for late submission, as specified in the 
<a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/students/units/cits4211">unit outline</a>.
